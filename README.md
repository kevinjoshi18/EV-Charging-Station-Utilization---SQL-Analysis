#  EV Charging Station Utilization Analysis

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging station usage using SQL. It covers revenue, user behavior, peak hours, energy consumption, and performance metrics across different cities, vehicles, and stations.

 **Files Included**
- `--------- SQL PROJECT - EV Charging Stat.sql` – SQL queries used for insights
- `vehicles_large.csv` – Dataset containing vehicle and session information

---

##  Key Insights from the Analysis

-  **Revenue**: Identified highest-earning stations, ranked by total revenue collected
-  **Usage Patterns**: Found peak hours, session durations, and most active months
-  **Vehicle Analysis**: Revealed most common vehicle models and energy consumption by type
-  **User Behavior**: Detected repeat users (3+ sessions) and top cities by charging activity
-  **Error Handling**: Flagged failed transactions for payment failure analysis

---

##  Queries Included

The project uses **10 core SQL queries**, including:

1. **Total revenue by station**
2. **Average charging time per session**
3. **Top 5 most utilized stations**
4. **Peak charging hours**
5. **Monthly revenue trends**
6. **Repeat user detection**
7. **Popular vehicle models**
8. **Average kWh consumption by vehicle type**
9. **Failed transactions report**
10. **Top cities by charging sessions**

##  Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL syntax)**
- **CSV Data for session & vehicle info**
- **Any SQL Workbench / GUI (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)**
